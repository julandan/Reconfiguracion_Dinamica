  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------
WARNING:Pack:2515 - The LUT-1 inverter
   "i_FSM_diramico_iz_slow/activa_led_e1_INV_0" failed to join the OLOGIC comp
   matched to output buffer "GPIO_LED_E_OBUF".  This may result in suboptimal
   timing.  The LUT-1 inverter i_FSM_diramico_iz_slow/activa_led_e1_INV_0 drives
   multiple loads.
WARNING:Pack:2515 - The LUT-1 inverter
   "i_FSM_dinamico_drc_fast/activa_led_w1_INV_0" failed to join the OLOGIC comp
   matched to output buffer "GPIO_LED_W_OBUF".  This may result in suboptimal
   timing.  The LUT-1 inverter i_FSM_dinamico_drc_fast/activa_led_w1_INV_0
   drives multiple loads.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net CONTROL_cs_ila_0[13] is
   sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE
   pin to control the loading of data into the flip-flop.

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:LIT:243 - Logical network CONTROL_cs_ila_0[7] has no load.
INFO:LIT:395 - The above info message is repeated 23 more times for the

   To see the details of these info messages, please use the -detail switch.
INFO:MapLib:562 - No environment variables are currently set.
INFO:LIT:244 - All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew
   rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs
   can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs.
INFO:Pack:1716 - Initializing temperature to 85.000 Celsius. (default - Range:
   0.000 to 85.000 Celsius)
INFO:Pack:1720 - Initializing voltage to 0.950 Volts. (default - Range: 0.950 to
   1.050 Volts)

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
---------------------------------
  47 block(s) removed
  27 block(s) optimized away
  32 signal(s) removed

Section 5 - Removed Logic
-------------------------

The trimmed logic report below shows the logic removed from your design due to
sourceless or loadless signals, and VCC or ground connections.  If the removal
of a signal or symbol results in the subsequent removal of an additional signal
or symbol, the message explaining that second removal will be indented.  This
indentation will be repeated as a chain of related logic is removed.

To quickly locate the original cause for the removal of a chain of logic, look
above the place where that logic is listed in the trimming report, then locate
the lines that are least indented (begin at the leftmost edge).

Section 10 - Timing Report
--------------------------
A logic-level (pre-route) timing report can be generated by using Xilinx static
timing analysis tools, Timing Analyzer (GUI) or TRCE (command line), with the
mapped NCD and PCF files. Please note that this timing report will be generated
using estimated delay information. For accurate numbers, please generate a
timing report with the post Place and Route NCD file.

For more information about the Timing Analyzer, consult the Xilinx Timing
Analyzer Reference Manual; for more information about TRCE, consult the Xilinx
Command Line Tools User Guide "TRACE" chapter.
